                <h2>DETROIT</h2>
                <p>
                    While unfortunate and not entirely wanted, our first location was in fact Detroit. You can feel free to visit
                    this location any time, however we cannot guarantee the condition of it. At the very least, you will
                    be able to view what is left of it.

                <h2>Liurnia of the Lakes</h2>
                <p>
                    We chose to settle for the most calm location in The Lands Between. Under the view of the Queen herself, we are 
                    frequently visited by the numerous scholars and vagrants in the area. Rest assured, this shard of light will
                    help guide you to wherever you need to go.

                <h2>Baldur's Gate</h2>
                <p>
                    Arguably the best city in all of Faerûn, Baldur's Gate was an obvious choice for us. It has brought us excellent
                    business and there is never a dull moment here. When you come here, make sure you and your party are well 
                    prepared for the adventures that follow.
